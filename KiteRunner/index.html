                <h1>Welcome! </h1>
                <text>The Kite Runner is a novel, written by Khaled Hosseini, that may be fiction but it displays the very real reality of Hazara's face in Afghanistan. The Hazaras face constant discrimination and have for decades. The genocide they endure is rarely talked about and Hosseini’s novel sheds the needed light on the extremely overlooked humanitarian crisis of this minority group. It’s extremely important to know what is going on in the world as an overlooked crisis in another country can mean thousands of suffering. Understanding when, where, and why a certain group of people suffer or face any kind of human rights violations is just the first step to ending injustice towards others. Spreading awareness restores faith not just in our own communities but within communities across the globe.

                    <p> In the Kite Runner, the most prominent social injustice that’s discussed in the novel is racial and religious discrimination. The two main characters are not only of different classes but one of them faces extreme discrimination because of his ethnic and religious identity. Because he is a Hazara he is disrespected and endures prejudice throughout the entire novel. Hosseini is an activist who highlights the issues within Afghanistan through his novels. The heart-wrenching story he tells is hard to read but truly tells the very real reality of Hazaras that brings awareness to those who did not know the injustice towards this minority group.
