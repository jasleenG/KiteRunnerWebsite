            </div>
            <div class="left">

                <p>The crisis in Xinjiang is the alleged persecution of the Uyghur Muslim minority in the region by the Chinese government. According to reports, the government has been detaining Uyghur Muslims in “re-education” camps where they are subjected to forced labor, torture, religious suppression, and political indoctrination (Maizland). As the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum cites, “Leaked government documents reveal that the state is, in fact, targeting people based on religious observances, such as praying or growing a beard, as well as family background”(USHMM).  In addition to the camps, the government has also been accused of implementing policies to suppress Uyghur culture and religion, such as destroying historical mosques in the area, camera installations in homes for monitoring, banning certain practices, and assimilating the region with Han Chinese migration. 

                According to PBS News, it wasn’t until satellite images of camp constructions with watch towers and barbed wire fences emerged the Chinese government finally chose to even acknowledge the camps, calling them “re-education centers” for offensive criminals (Wood). With no independent party accessibility to the region, it is hard to find reliable full details of the atrocities going on in Xinjiang. China claims that the actions they are taking in Xinjiang are precautionary as the Uyghurs hold extremist views that are a threat to security and economic prosperity (Mackinnon). The argument for this is two attacks that occurred in 2013 and 2014 by a terrorist group, East Turkestan Islamic Movement. Reliable information about this group is limited but China reports this group to have connections with Afghanistan’s Taliban, and that since the group is majorly Uyghurs, all Uyghurs were a threat to the nation. Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies however writes that there is no unified Uyghur agenda. “While some Uighurs seek a separate state, others prefer to maintain a cultural distinction and autonomous rapport with China. Some are also content with integration into the Chinese system. Moreover, ETIM has never served as the sole representative of Uighur separatism. Many separatist political organizations among the million-strong Uighur émigré community are not radical, nor do they advocate violence”(Davis). Witness accounts also support that the Chinese government is targeting innocent civilians and campaigning an ethnic cleansing of all minority groups in the area by biasing information with their own narrative of the events.

                <p> Xinjiang, China is an autonomous region, which means it has its own local government that is directly below the federal government. These autonomous regions were created for China’s ethnic minority groups to give them “independence” but many sources report that the actual functioning of these governments is simply an extension of the federal power (Briney). Xinjiang is the largest autonomous region located with an area of 640,930 square miles or 1/6th of China’s territory (Hseih). Xinjimag has abundant oil reserves and is China’s largest gas-producing region. It's home to 13 major ethnic groups and borders 8 countries, more than any other Chinese region or province.

                Uyghurs are a Turkic-speaking ethnic group that primarily resides in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in northwest China. They have a distinct culture and language that sets them apart from the dominant Han Chinese population in the region. According to the United States Commission on Internation Religious Freedom (USCIRF), the Uyghurs are one of the largest ethnic groups in Xinjiang and makeup approximately 45% of the region’s population (USCRF). They are predominantly Muslim, with the majority following Sunni Islam. They also have unique cuisine that incorporates Central Asian, Middle Eastern, and Chinese Influences. Their principal food crops are wheat, corn (maize), kaoliang (a form of sorghum), and melons. The chief industrial crop is cotton, which has long been grown in the area (The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica). Many Uyghurs are employed in petroleum extraction, mining, and manufacturing in urban centers.

            <div class="left">
                <p>Sayragul witnessed the Chinese government trying to wipe out all the ethnolinguistic identities of all of China’s citizens. Massacres, illegal mass arrests, detentions in the camps, cutting off the citizens' communication, and constant surveillance is just the beginning of what she and countless others have had to; and still do have to endure. In 2017, Sayragul had her passport confiscated and was forced to teach in a concentration camp, and was threatened with death if she refused the job. In the camp, she had to teach Chinese propaganda to people of all ages and genders. The detainees were constantly being tortured, raped, and starved, all of these things done to make these people forget their roots, and their identity. Sayragul found strength in her Creator, and her children, who she desperately wanted to see again. After Sayragul fled her home and escaped to Kazakhstan, she still suffers bad physical and mental health. 
                    Ever since she escaped to Kazakhstan, Sayragul has lost all contact with her family and it’s speculated that her 70-plus-year-old mother and her sister were taken to concentration camps. Her house is bugged with cameras and her family’s phones are tapped, so they have no way of communicating with the outside world. When Sayragul escaped, she continuously applied for asylum and was eventually granted asylum in Sweden with her husband and two children. She says “I will never forget the camp.” and “I cannot forget the eyes of the prisoners… They are innocent.” (Gibbs). Despite her freedom, Sayragul will be tormented by these memories for life.

                <p>Aséna Tahir Izgil was born in Kashgar, a city in China's Xinjiang region, and was forced to flee her homeland due to the persecution of Uyghur Muslims. In an interview with The Atlantic, she shared her experience of being separated from her family and the trauma of living in a state of constant fear. Even after leaving Xinjiang, she feels like everyone around her is ignorant, they are so focused on living their perfect lives, they don't care about what is happening in the rest of the world. Even just speaking about the government or giving an opinion in public is otherworldly to her, because she couldn't do that freely in her old home. She feels out of place day and night because she feels like she ‘knows too much’, and can't focus on the things in front of her as the trauma of her past clouds her head. Aséna states, “It’s like being a drop of oil, but you are in a  cup of water.” (Izgil).  Aséna says she just wants her father to have his freedom, which he finally got in his 50’s, but she says it’s hard to just let go of your Ughyur identity and they don’t have the luxury of not knowing about the genocide.

                <h1>Perpetrators: CCP</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="left">
                <p>While the conflict is racial discrimination between a majority population of Han Chinese to ethnic minorities, the divisions between them are constructed and enforced by the CCP. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is China’s ruling party. It was founded in 1921 and has been in power since 1949 when the Communist revolution overthrew the Nationalist government (Albert). The party has a hierarchical structure with General Secretary, Xi Jinping at the very top. The CCP controls all aspects of political and social life in China, including the government, military, media, and education. The CCP has a long history of promoting a unified national identity and assimilating minority cultures into the dominant Han Chinese culture (Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica). The party’s interest is based on a belief that a strong centralized state requires a cohesive national identity and that ethnic diversity and cultural differences are sources of instability to the party’s power. This interest can be seen in the party’s campaign of the “Chinese Dream” which promotes the goal of national rejuvenation and restoration of China’s historical greatness (Foreign Affairs of CCP).  

                </p>
                <p>
                    Specifically, related to the case of the Uyghur Crisis, the CCP has a complicated attitude towards Islam. While it recognizes Islam as one of the official religions in China, Buddhism is the promoted religion for the entire nation. Additionally, China has a long history of tensions with Muslim-majority countries, and Xinjiang borders 5 Muslim majority countries and 3 with significant Muslim populations. The fear is infiltration from these countries could cause havoc and loss of the region. This is especially a priority concern to the CCP as PBS explains, the land is a designated special economic zone with rich oil and mineral supplies. Xinjiang is a key part of the country’s Belt and Road Initiative (Wood). 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking at a conference in Xinjiang, Xi stated, “The whole party must treat the implementation of the Xinjiang strategy as a political task, and work hard to implement it completely and accurately to ensure that the Xinjiang work always maintains in the correct political direction”(Xi). Additionally, he stated that “Sinicizing Islam” was essential to achieve a healthy development in the area.

                <h1>1. 2009 Riots</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="left">
                <p>
                    In July 2009, protests turned into violent riots in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang. The riots were triggered by long-standing tensions between the Uyghur population and the newly immigrated Han Chinese majority. Specifically, many sources point to a fight that occurred in a factory between Uyghurs and Han workers. One Uyghur was accused of rape, which lead to a fight over the accusation, resulting in two Uyghurs being killed. While numerous sources report this incident as the truth, many acknowledge the lack of accuracy in the death count of Uyghurs and the cause of the fight. This incident is just one example of many tensions going on in Xinjiang however as since 1987 Uyghurs had been experiencing discrimination, economic marginalization, and restrictions on their religious and cultural practices. These riots were met with brutal force from Chinese security forces, resulting in the death of around 200 people. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the riots, the Chinese government implemented a severe crackdown on the Uyghur population using the premise of “a concern for national security” as justification. Thousands of Uyghurs were arrested and detained and strict surveillance measures using facial recognition technology and compulsory DNA sampling. The Chinese government also used 9/11, the twin tower attacks in 2001 by the terrorist group Al Qaeda as justification for the need for a strict intervention in the area. Reports have been published by the CCP reporting connection of the Uyghurs to Afghanistan’s Taliban and the replication of the groups. 
  

                </p>
                <p>
                    The impact of the 2009 riots and subsequent crackdown on the Uyghur population has been devastating. It was in 2009 that the Chinese government passed a campaign to clamp down on the “extremist behaviors” in Xinjiang. All policies aimed at suppressing Uyghur culture and identity, including the mass detention of Uyghurs in “re-education” camps, have been deemed as necessary by the government or unacknowledged.

                <p>
                    The years between 2014 and 2017 saw a disturbing wave of campaigns of destruction and rewriting history in China's Xinjiang region. The suppression began in 2014, targeting what the Chinese government called "religious extremism" in the region. The government deployed massive security forces, established re-education centers, and imposed heavy surveillance on the region. The Chinese government also began a campaign of destruction of religious sites, including the demolition of mosques and other religious structures, as well as the erasure of Uyghur history and culture.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The government replaced Uyghur-language signs with Chinese characters, banned the use of the Uyghur language in schools and government, and destroyed Uyghur cultural artifacts. This campaign of cultural erasure has been compared to the actions of the Taliban in Afghanistan, who destroyed ancient Buddhist statues in the early 2000s. The Chinese government has consistently denied any wrongdoing in Xinjiang, calling the reports of human rights abuses "lies" and "fake news." However, the evidence of what is happening in the region is overwhelming, and many countries and human rights organizations have called for action to be taken to stop the atrocities being committed against the Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.

                    According to reports from international journalists, Xinjiang is said to have been turned into a surveillance state, with millions of people being closely monitored through cutting-edge technology. Under the leadership of Chen, Xinjiang was divided into squares of about five hundred people, with each square being monitored by a police station equipped with cameras that regularly scan identification cards, take photographs and fingerprints, and search cell phones. The use of facial recognition cameras is also prevalent in some cities, with police checkpoints set up every hundred yards or so. The government implemented a program called Physicals for All, which requires citizens to provide biometric data that is collected and stored in a database called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform. Artificial intelligence is used to identify so-called suspicious people, leading to the detention of over fifteen thousand Xinjiang residents.

                <p>
                    Many aspects of Muslim life have been erased, with Communist Party members recruited to stay in Uyghur homes and report on any perceived "extremist" behaviors. Thousands of mosques have been destroyed, halal food has become harder to find, and Uyghur and other minority women have reported forced sterilizations and intrauterine device insertions. Government data analyzed by experts also shows a significant decline in natural population growth rates in areas with high Uyghur populations.  Uyghur parents are also  banned from giving certain names to their babies.

            <div class="left">
                <p>
                    Since 2017, between 800,000 to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslims, including ethnic Kazakhs and Uzbeks, have been detained in Xinjiang. Experts suggest that reeducation efforts were initiated in 2014 and expanded in 2017. Despite the Chinese government refers to these facilities as "vocational education and training centers," international media outlets and researchers commonly refer to them as reeducation camps, internment camps, or detention camps, with some activists describing them as concentration camps. Most individuals detained in these camps were not charged with any crimes and had no means to challenge their detention. The primary reason for the arrest was often simply practicing Islam, with many Uyghurs being labeled as extremists. In a report released in 2022, the UN human rights office found patterns of torture or other cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment in the camps between 2017 and 2019 based on interviews with dozens of people, including 26 individuals.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to wrongfully arresting innocent civilians, these camps have been described as highly oppressive and abusive. Former detainees and their families have reported that individuals are forcibly taken from their homes, workplaces, or on the streets, often without explanation or any formal legal proceedings. Once in the camps, detainees are subjected to intense ideological indoctrination, which includes being forced to renounce their Islamic faith, speak Mandarin, and praise the Chinese Communist Party. Detainees are also subjected to physical and psychological abuse, including torture, beatings, and solitary confinement. Many detainees have also reported being forced to engage in hard labor, including manufacturing goods for export to other countries. In addition, there have been reports of forced sterilization and other forms of reproductive control, as well as organ harvesting from detainees. These abuses have been widely condemned by the international community, with many calling for the camps to be shut down and for the Chinese government to be held accountable for its human rights violations.

                <p>
                    From the accounts gathered it can be inferred that the COVID-19 lockdown had a significant impact on the Uyghurs, especially when the height of the “re-education camps” were running when the virus first spread. Numbers about this have not been explored but mass suppression in the form of prison-like lockdowns can be speculated as of 2022. Pak Yiu at Nikkei Asia states that while the rest of China was easing up on lockdown measures Xinjiang had set China’s record for the most prolonged lockdown of 3 months with intense no-leave policies, leaving residents even struggling to get basic necessities. As New York Times states, “the lockdowns have left residents in dire straits, with trouble securing food and other necessities, like medication and menstruation supplies”(Che). As one Uyghur reported living in the capital of Xinjiang, Urumqi, “They can't open the door and there are cameras everywhere to make sure they aren't able to leave. The relaxations don't make any difference”(Yiu). Some victims also reported to Associated Press that some areas had their homes physically chained shut, and at least 10 residents died because of an inability to leave. News of this fire caused national outrage all over China, however much coverage of protests was taken down within hours by the Chinese government. While China started 2023 with the end of its Zero Covid Policy in response to national dissent, it is highly likely this has not included the Xinjiang region.

                    In the present day, China still denies having committed any human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region at any period of time. Xinjiang is still being intensively monitored with limited ability to communicate with people beyond the region. In addition to the constant frequent internet blackouts, many Uyghur websites have been banned from the internet. Masha Borak from Wired reports that “Uyghurs in Xinjiang now use domestic platforms and apps made by China’s tech giants. Although WeChat still hosts Uyghur-language accounts, the platform is known for its censorship system”(Borak). This situation of censorship has left Uyghurs with little ability to communicate freely with each other and significantly beyond the region they live in. It's important to listen to the few accounts that are able to escape this suppression so we can invoke global change and stop this genocide.

                <p>
                    While Uyghurs in Xinjiang are forcibly silenced, foreign countries and international action are also being willed to remain silent because of China’s economic superpower. Adrian Zenz states, “The Uyghurs are becoming hopeless because the world is letting them down. In 2019, they were more hopeful because there was a feeling that more evidence would lead to action, but nothing has changed. People and governments are not acting on the evidence that is out”(Standish). Small policies have been passed by the United States such as visa restrictions on Chinese Officials, sanctions, and a ban on cotton and cotton products produced from forced labor in Xinjiang. According to UN News in June the UN, “urged the Chinese Government to “cooperate fully” with the UN human rights system over abuse allegations, and grant them “unhindered access –, particularly to prisons and detention centres”(UN). Progress of their cooperation has been slow and unsuccessful.

                    The United States is planning on having a House hearing on March 23rd, held by their newly formed committee focused on China. The House panel will be hearing from a panel of witnesses including Gulbahar Haitiwaji, an Uyghur who suffered from years at the “reeducation camps” and house arrest, Qelbinur Sidik, an ethnic Uzbek who was forced to be a teacher at a camp, who both were able to flee the country and now reside in Europe and Nury Turkel, a prominent Uyghur American lawyer who advocated for the U.S. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act that last year largely banned imports from Xinjiang (Martina). The purpose of this hearing is to rally American support for intervention in the crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and to protest against China’s continuous denial. It is also to argue to Americans that the crimes going on in China directly impacts them. As  top Democrat, U.S. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi states in the article, “It's in the goods produced with slave labor, it's the degradation of human rights that makes the world less safe, and it's the ceaseless persecution of Uyghurs abroad that includes those living in America”(Martina). This event is an encouragement for future international involvement and prevention of crimes in Xinjiang but is no guarantee of success.
